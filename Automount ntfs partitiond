The first thing to do is find the UIID of the parttion you want to automount on startup.
Execute this "sudo blkid"
find the partition  you want as mentioned before and copy it UIID like so "UUID="01D2C865CE7EBC30""
now open "sudo nano /etc/fstab" to edit the new entry and place this code there "UUID="01D2C865CE7EBC30" /media/files ntfs rw,auto,users,exec,nls=utf8,umask=000,gid=46,uid=1000    0   0"
here the "UUID="01D2C865CE7EBC30"" code istheone we take before and in the "/media/files" you can name "files" whatever you want.
now just give a "sudo mount -a" and done.
Everytime you start your system now the partition you choosed shoul be mounted under "/media/name you gave to your mount point" and with read/write permissions.
